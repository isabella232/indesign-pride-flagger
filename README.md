## FAQ

### Why is the plugin called "Pride Flagger"?

Because it adds pride flags to your document.

### Should you use pride flags in commercial settings?

Yes, you should. Pride flags are a symbol of acceptance and inclusion, and should be used in all settings, including commercial ones.

However, you should make sure that you don't just add pride flags to your documents, but also make sure that you are actively supporting the LGBTQIA+ community. Otherwise, it might get seen as "rainbow-washing" (similar to "green-washing"), which the community doesn't usually appreciate.

### Don't you also do a kind of rainbow washing by building this plugin and thus creating a product from it?

No. First of all, I myself am part of the LGBTQIA+ community (to be more precise, of the üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è _T_ and the _A_ in the acronym), so I'm not doing this for money. I'm not selling this plugin (and instead provide it as free and open-source software). I'm just building it because I think it's fun, and because I myself want to use it.

### Why would you want to add pride flags to your documents?

Because it's fun, and because it shows that you support the LGBTQIA+ community.

### Why are there only a few flags?

I'm adding more flags as I go. If you want to add a flag, feel free to open a pull request.

### Is this the first (complete) open-source UXP-based plugin for Adobe InDesign ever published?

I ... think so üòÖ.
